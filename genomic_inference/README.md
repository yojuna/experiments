# Genomic Data Analysis

Motivation: first, need to find out:
- publicly available open source genomic datasets
- current SOTA and potential architectures/models for analyzing genomic data
- what works and what doesn't
    - missing links or open challenges to applying ML methods to genomic analysis

- build a easy to use, relatively small llm type model to make it easier to analyse/predict downstream tasks for available genomic data
- visualization of data and results of 2nd order analysis over currently available data
